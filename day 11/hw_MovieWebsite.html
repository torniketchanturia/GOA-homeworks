        <p> released from <i> October 4, 1995 - March 27, 1996 </i>; rated <strong>8.5/10</strong>
        on IMDb</p>
        <p>Anime where 14 year olds have to pilot evas (huge robots) to LITERALLY fight the angels
        who seek destruction of the world, while dealing with their trauma, insecurities
        and loneliness. It takes place after the 2nd Impact which took out half the population
        of earth and they have to avoid the 3rd impact which can 
        <strong>DESTROY THE WHOLE WORLD.</strong> While it may be hard to grasp, it dwelves really
        well into the human's psychology, our flaws, identity, life and the <u>meaning</u> of it.
        The Manga, the anime and the movies take different approaches as if what would happen if
        the universe was slightly different, which makes everything way more interesting than
        it already was.</p>
