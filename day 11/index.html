    <h1> SCP </h1>
    <p> <b> The SCP Foundation </b> is a fictional organization featured in stories created by 
        contributors 
        on the SCP Wiki, a wiki-based collaborative writing project. Within the project's shared 
        fictional universe, the SCP Foundation is a secret organization that is responsible for 
        capturing, containing, and studying various paranormal, supernatural, and other mysterious 
        phenomena (known as "anomalies" or "SCPs"), while also keeping their existence hidden 
        from the rest of society.</p>
        <h2>History</h2>
        <h3>SCP-173 image removal</h3>
    <p> The original <u>SCP-173</u> post in 2007, <i> used an image of the sculpture Untitled 2004 
        by the artist <u><b>Izumi Katō</b></u> </i>, which was photographed by Keisuke Yamamoto. 
        The image remained on the 
        site with a warning attached until February 2022, when staff made the decision to remove it. 
        The SCP Foundation said on Twitter that the artistic <strong> vision of Izumi Katō 
        was <i>"forcibly hijacked"</i> by the statue's association with SCP, 
        </strong> and that they could not <em> "fully undo the damage done". </em> At the request 
        of Wesley Williams, 
        a new image was not placed in the article, so that readers would have to imagine it 
        themselves. Many original interpretations of SCP-173 were created by the community in 
        the wake of the decision. </p>
