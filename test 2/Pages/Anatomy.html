    <h1>Anatomy</h1>
    <p><b><strong>The main feature</strong></b> of a true <i>jellyfish</i> is the <u>umbrella-shaped</u> bell. This is a hollow structure consisting of a mass
        of transparent jelly-like matter known as mesoglea, which forms the hydrostatic skeleton of the animal.[25] The
        mesoglea is <em>95% or more</em> composed of water,[30] and also contains collagen and other fibrous proteins, as well as
        wandering amebocytes that can engulf debris and bacteria. The mesoglea is bordered by the epidermis on the
        outside and the gastrodermis on the inside. The edge of the bell is often divided into rounded lobes known as
        lappets, which allow the bell to flex. In the gaps or niches between the lappets are dangling rudimentary sense
        organs known as rhopalia, and the margin of the bell often bears tentacles.</p>
