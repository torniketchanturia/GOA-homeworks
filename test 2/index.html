    <h1>Jellyfish</h1>
    <p>Jellyfish, also known as sea jellies or simply jellies, are the medusa-phase of
        certain gelatinous members of the subphylum Medusozoa, which is a major part of
        the phylum Cnidaria. Jellyfish are mainly free-swimming marine animals, although
        a few are anchored to the seabed by stalks rather than being motile. They are made
        of an umbrella-shaped main body made of mesoglea, known as the bell, and a collection
        of trailing tentacles on the underside.</p>
