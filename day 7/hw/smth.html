<h1>Jellyfish</h1>
<p>Jellyfish, also known as sea jellies or simply jellies, are the medusa-phase of certain gelatinous
     members of the subphylum Medusozoa, which is a major part of the phylum Cnidaria. Jellyfish 
     are mainly free-swimming marine animals, although a few are anchored to the seabed by stalks
    rather than being motile. They are made of an umbrella-shaped main body made of mesoglea, 
    known as the bell, and a collection of trailing tentacles on the underside.

Via pulsating contractions, the bell can provide propulsion for locomotion through open water. The 
tentacles are armed with stinging cells and may be used to capture prey or to defend against 
predators. Jellyfish have a complex life cycle, and the medusa is normally the sexual phase, 
which produces planula larvae. These then disperse widely and enter a sedentary polyp phase which 
may include asexual budding before reaching sexual maturity. <br>
Jellyfish are found all over the world, from surface waters to the deep sea. Scyphozoans 
(the "true jellyfish") are exclusively marine, but some hydrozoans with a similar appearance 
live in fresh water. Large, often colorful, jellyfish are common in coastal zones worldwide. 
The medusae of most species are fast-growing, and mature within a few months then die soon after
breeding, but the polyp stage, attached to the seabed, may be much more long-lived. Jellyfish 
have been in existence for at least 500 million years,[1] and possibly 700 million years or more, 
making them the oldest multi-organ animal group.</p>

<h2>Names</h2>
<p>The name jellyfish, in use since 1796,[4] has traditionally been applied to medusae and all 
    similar animals including the comb jellies (ctenophores, another phylum).[5][6] The term 
    jellies or sea jellies is more recent, having been introduced by public aquaria in an effort 
    to avoid use of the word "fish" with its modern connotation of an animal with a backbone, 
    though shellfish, cuttlefish and starfish are not vertebrates either.[7][8] In scientific 
    literature, "jelly" and "jellyfish" have been used interchangeably.[9][10] Many sources 
    refer to only scyphozoans as "true jellyfish".[11]
A group of jellyfish is called a "smack"[12] or a "smuck".</p>
<h2>Anatomy</h2>
<p>The main feature of a true jellyfish is the umbrella-shaped bell. This is a hollow structure 
consisting of a mass of transparent jelly-like matter known as mesoglea, which forms the 
hydrostatic skeleton of the animal.[25] The mesoglea is 95% or more composed of water,[30]
and also contains collagen and other fibrous proteins, as well as wandering amebocytes that can
engulf debris and bacteria. The mesogloea is bordered by the epidermis on the outside and the
gastrodermis on the inside. The edge of the bell is often divided into rounded lobes known as
lappets, which allow the bell to flex. In the gaps or niches between the lappets are dangling 
rudimentary sense organs known as rhopalia, and the margin of the bell often bears tentacles.[25]<br>

<h3>Box jellyfish eye</h3>
<p>The study of jellyfish eye evolution is an intermediary to a better understanding of how visual 
    systems evolved on Earth. Jellyfish exhibit immense variation in visual systems ranging from 
    photoreceptive cell patches seen in simple photoreceptive systems to more derived complex eyes 
    seen in box jellyfish.[40] Major topics of jellyfish visual system research (with an emphasis 
    on box jellyfish) include: the evolution of jellyfish vision from simple to complex visual 
    systems), the eye morphology and molecular structures of box jellyfish (including comparisons
    to vertebrate eyes), and various uses of vision including task-guided behaviors and niche 
    specialization.</p>
<h4>Utility as a model organism</h4>
<p>Box jellyfish eyes are a visual system that is sophisticated in numerous ways. These intricacies
    include the considerable variation within the morphology of box jellyfishes' eyes (including 
    their task/behavior specification), and the molecular makeup of their eyes including: 
    photoreceptors, opsins, lenses, and synapses.[41] The comparison of these attributes 
    to more derived visual systems can allow for a further understanding of how the evolution 
    of more derived visual systems may have occurred, and puts into perspective how box jellyfish 
    can play the role as an evolutionary/developmental model for all visual systems.</p>
<h5>Characteristics</h5>
<p>Box jellyfish visual systems are both diverse and complex, comprising multiple photosystems. 
    There is likely considerable variation in visual properties between species of box jellyfish 
    given the significant inter-species morphological and physiological variation. Eyes tend to 
    differ in size and shape, along with number of receptors (including opsins), and physiology 
    across species of box jellyfish.</p>
